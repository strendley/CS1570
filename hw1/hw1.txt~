//Algorithm for Dropping Eggs
1. Determine the minimum and maximum floors.
   - Minimum floors will be 1. (Default)
   - Maximum floors will be 99. (Default)
2. Climb to floor 50. Drop egg #1 from the balcony of floor 50.
3. Based on the results from the (previous--if applicable) drop, adjust the
   potential minimum and maximum floors.
   A. If the egg broke in the (previous--if applicable) attempt, set new max
      to the current floor level.
   B. If the egg did not break in the (previous--if applicable) attempt, set
      the new minimum to the current floor.
4. Determine the new test floor based on the results from step 3--Add the
maximum floor to the minimum floor, then divide the sum by 2.
5. Climb to the new floor determined in step #4. Drop the next egg.
6. Repeat steps #3, #4, and #5 until all eggs are used or until the min is
   greater than or equal to the maximum.

//Algorithm for OT Pay and Working Status
1. Prompt user for information:
   A. OT Hours (OTHrs)
   B. Sick Days Week1 (wk1)
   C. Sick Days Week2 (wk2)
   D. Sick Days Week3 (wk3)
   E. Sick Days Week4 (wk4)
   F. Base Pay (base)
2. Calculate Sick Days
   A. If the sick days in week 1 or week 3 are greater than 0, then sick days in
      week 1 and 3 will be added together, then multiplied by 8 hours for each 
      sick day taken.
   B. If the sick days in week 2 are greater than 1, then sick days in week
      2 will be subtracted by 1 (for the free sick day) and them multiplied by 8
      hours for each sick day taken.
   C. Repeat step 2B for week 4, using week 4's input.
3. Determine Status
   A. Add sick days from week 1, 2, 3, and 4 together.
   B. If the total sick days is equal to 1 and the OT Hours are greater than
or equal to 40, the status will remain "working" and the bonus will be
calculated.
       I. Calculate the bonus by multiplying the base pay by 30.
   C. If the total sick days are less than 1 and the OT Hours are greater
      than or equal to 80, the status will be "terminated" and the bonus will be
      0 dollars.
4. Calculate Total
   A. If Status = terminated, OT Pay = 5 dollars.
   B. If OT Hours are <= 30, OT Pay = ((base * 1.5) * OTHrs)
   C. If OT Hours are > 30, OT Pay  = ((base * 2.0) * OTHrs)
5. Output OT Pay & Status

//Algorithm for Lexicographic Difference
1. Prompt user for input.
   A. Word 1 
   B. Word 2
2. Compare characters
   A. If char1 = char2, loop to next characters
   B. If there are no characters left to compare, lexdif = 0
   C. If char1 > char2, lexdif = char1 - char2
   D. If char1 < char2, lexdif = char2 - char1
3. Output Lexdif
